# Neural-Network-Project
Identification of handwritten characters (numeric digits) using Neural Networks

•	Mnist_train is the data-set for training the neural network
•	Mnist_test is the data-set for testing the neural network
•	Main_v2_up to A3  is the code up to A3 question
•	Main_v2_up to A4  is the code up to A4 question
•	Main_v2_A5 is the code for A5 question and for the rest project
